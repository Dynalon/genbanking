		for authentication, each requst must carry a cookie named "authToken" with a secret value,
		else access will be denied. The secret serves as an authentication password.
		
		The SHA1 hash of the secret is specified here for security. You NEED to calculate the sha1
		hash of a secret (i.e. via commandline: echo -n "mysecret" | sha1sum - ", or any other sha1
		hasher) and put the hash here. Afterwards, every request to the webservice must send a
		cookie named "authToken" and have the UNHASHED secret as value (in the above example this
		is "mysecret").
		
		WARNING: You can comment out the next line, then no authentication will take place and your
		webservice will be open to everyone. If you decide to do so, you MUST take further measures
		to block access to your webservice (IP filtering, VPN, etc.). This is highly not recommended,
		you have been warned!!!
